Summary: 

Chapter 1-4:

Go back thru chapters 1-6 and find the activities that the author wants you to write things down. For example, in the first chapter or two he asks to write down childhood trauma so that you can "flip that shit". 

Taking Souls - The ability to use the expectations of others on yourself to your advantage by keeping them in place with your extensive ability to keep up and not crack under their pressure.. (this is fascinating should look into it more).

p.130ish
Highlight from the author - "Taking Souls is a ticket to finding your own reserve power and riding a seond wind."
Taking someone's soul means you've gained a tactical advantage. Know the terrain you're operating in, when and where you can push boundaries and when you should fall in line."

Figure out what boundaries you can push to catch/ride your second wind! https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/avatar-the-last-airbender-e1537288195158-700x363.jpg

-At work I've already been doing this to a great extent. But the question is who else? Paul comes to mind about leetcode. Perhaps I show him proof of the leet code problems I do every day and do this for an extended period of time. Perhaps these posts are for the leetcode discussion boards.

Chapter 5 Summary: Straight up about what hell week was like and how he finally cracked his foundation and would seek out pain like running with broken legs to calouce his mind. Each step mean more calouce and he was getting stronger.

chapter 5 Challenge: Choose any obstacle in your way, or set a new goal, and visualize overcoming or achieving it. I start by painting a picture of what my success looks and feels like. I'll think about it every day and that feeling propels me forward when I'm trainign, or taking any task I choose. You must also visualize the challenges. Goggins would drive a racing course before he would run on it. That would get him ready for any potential challenges. Strategic visualization ahead of time. Calouse the mind.
