Let's create a new identity. An evolution. A charizard... 

Summary: 

Chapter 1-4:

Go back thru chapters 1-6 and find the activities that the author wants you to write things down. For example, in the first chapter or two he asks to write down childhood trauma so that you can "flip that shit". 

Taking Souls - The ability to use the expectations of others on yourself to your advantage by keeping them in place with your extensive ability to keep up and not crack under their pressure.. (this is fascinating should look into it more).

p.130ish
Highlight from the author - "Taking Souls is a ticket to finding your own reserve power and riding a seond wind."
Taking someone's soul means you've gained a tactical advantage. Know the terrain you're operating in, when and where you can push boundaries and when you should fall in line."

Figure out what boundaries you can push to catch/ride your second wind! https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/avatar-the-last-airbender-e1537288195158-700x363.jpg





Challenges:

Challenge #4 Choose any competitive situation you're in right now. Who isyour opponent? Is it your teacher boss or unruly client? No matter how they're treating you there is only one way to not earn their respect, but turn the tables. Excellence.
-At work I've already been doing this to a great extent. But the question is who else? Paul comes to mind about leetcode. Perhaps I show him proof of the leet code problems I do every day and do this for an extended period of time. Perhaps these posts are for the leetcode discussion boards.

Chapter 5 Summary: Straight up about what hell week was like and how he finally cracked his foundation and would seek out pain like running with broken legs to calouce his mind. Each step mean more calouce and he was getting stronger.

chapter 5 Challenge: Choose any obstacle in your way, or set a new goal, and visualize overcoming or achieving it. I start by painting a picture of what my success looks and feels like. I'll think about it every day and that feeling propels me forward when I'm trainign, or taking any task I choose. You must also visualize the challenges. Goggins would drive a racing course before he would run on it. That would get him ready for any potential challenges. Strategic visualization ahead of time. Calouse the mind.

Chapter 6 Summary: He went on an ultra marathon 100 miles. Similar to your half marathon (13miles). This is when he reached in his emotional cookie jar to relish his past accomplishments. He remembered all the pitfalls he overcame in his life. The fact that he figured out the ASVAB, became a better reader since he cheated in childhood, passed BUD/S, etc. Think of starting a bonfire, you start with a small piece and barely get a fire going. Then when you add to it you get a bunch. That's what it's like finding that inner drive to get you thru a marathon. But come on losing toe nails? I don't need to lose my toe nails to master my own mind. God is the master of my mind! Pain is not and to some extent it's foolish to think Pain is the master really...

Challenge: Make a list of cookies for your cookie jar. This I find to be valuable. I can remember the race I won in elementary school. I actually have so many it will be fun.. :)

Chapter 7 Summary: He ran a lot of races and realized there's a resivoir of potential in every human. Callousing his mind like crazy, not like any civilian, something only his mind has set him up for. Remove your minds 'govener' the thing that tells you what you're capable of. 

You will be made fun of. you will feel insecure. you may not be the best all the time. you me be the only portuguese guy, you may feel alone. Get over it!

Chapter 8 Summary: He had a heart attack...

Chapter 8 Challenge: Take notes of how you spend your time on your week.

Chapter 9 Summary: Platoon team missions. He was the head of his team but they couldn't handle tough stuff. He felt responsible in some way.. had to skip that part because natural readers glitched. He hit his glass ceiling becuase of his injuries?

Challenge 9 Challenge:Torch the complacey you feel gathering around you, your coworkers, and teammates in that rare air. Continue to put obstacle in front of you, because that's where you'll find the friction that will help you grow even stronger. Before you know it, you will stand alone. 

Chapter 10 Summary: He got injured and couldn't run anymore. He only could do pullups to raise for seal money now. He did it so much his hands looked like fucking hamburger's literally disgusting. 

Chapter 10 Challenge: It's all about mindset and where most people fail short is not thinking about their failures/successes during the preperation and execution stage of their attempt at some goal. Make a list of things you can fix in your failures, be brutly honest write them out and study them. Look at your calendar and make another attempt as soon as possibe. If you fall while chasing the carrot on a stick, get back up and keep running. That's a metaphor for life.
