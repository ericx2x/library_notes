Practice using your phone just as an alarm clock. Perhaps use your DS as an alarm clock. Don't check your phone every morning. Even a newspaper would serve you better than periodically and speradiocally checking your phone so much.

Create a youtube page in your notes app to go over the selected youtube videos you would wish to watch and watch them all at a specific time of day for a short amount of time. Try to not be as easily tempted by your phone. When doing ideal activities like bathroom or dishes instead just listen to nothing and think about nothing and let your brain go on auto pilot instead. It will be a much better tool than looking up whatever crazy things you're looking into anyhow..

Uninstall the youtube app. Just watch it on a computer. You will get a lot less anxious. Install Fire Emblem only on Sundays and play for 30 minutes. Place your phone on the bookshelf along with your wallet. Stop checking so much. It's meant for google maps and phone calls once in a long while. Perhaps even consider disabling your cellphone plan and just having internet at home. Consider buying a pen and small notebook Moleskine pocket-size. 

Remember Your Time = Google's Money. Are you so easy going with your time?

TODO lookup Samuel Morse (Morse code's story). Also, lookup the first phone call :) "What hath God wrought?"

Don't let your phone destroy your chance of making a meaningful and satisfying life..      

TODO explore some of the books notes section as if you were watching TV. Why ever bother with TV when you can come here and learn?
