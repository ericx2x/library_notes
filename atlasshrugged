Atlas Shrugged (My Review) - The book started with this rail road business. There was a guy named Henry Something? and Dagnny Taggard. Lots of love talk but also a lot of clean capitalist talk. There was some guy at the start that quit Dagny's railroad business and he was actually John Galt? This is figured out later. Then everyone is on Henry Reardon's back trying to get him to do something? Idk what they wanted from him but it signified that everyone's basically a lowlife that is a looting scum. Basically they can be all around you. I would equate the looters in this book with modern day liberals. Anyway, they pass some bill for equality or some shit. Obviously it doesn't work but Dagny gets Reardon to sign it cuz she has pussy. Reardon loses everything pretty much. Then later the bitch leaves his ass once she gets in some plane crash or some shit. and ends up in this place in coloardo that is the shit because all the people who aren't looters are there (even tho their numbers are limited). I think John Galt was among them. Also john galt is Atlas from greek mythology - he invented some motor that has the world on his shoulders. Then Dagny falls for him but she goes back to newyork. She basically leads Henry on and they do some shit. I think she starts to act sengible half way thru and finally speaks her mind. She should just have fired her staff and hired the poeple in coloardo but idk librals everywhere basically so it's not that easy. Then john galt gets on the speaker and gives an awesome speech. Basically librals are cowardly scum that dono't deserve a penny. Also money is the root of all good as seen by Fransico don Conye (the outwardly playboy who is just a capitalist baller underneath). Lots of shooting and killing is done by the capitalists to the looters at the end and the looters are seen for the animals they are essentially. Then JG does a $ sign in the air. The end.
